MR. BRIGGS'S PLEASURES OF HORSEKEEPING.


[Illustration: No. IV.

MR. BRIGGS, PERSUADED THAT "A GOOD HORSE CAN'T BE A BAD COLOUR," HAS
PURCHASED A SPOTTED AND HIGHLY TRAINED STEED FROM A CIRCUS; BUT THE
WORST OF HIM IS, THAT AMONGST OTHER THINGS, HE HAS BEEN TRAINED TO SIT
DOWN ON HIS HAUNCHES WHEN HE HEARS A BAND PLAY, AND YOU MAY IMAGINE HOW
DISCONCERTED POOR OLD BRIGGS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE DID SO.]


[Illustration: _A PLEASANT STATE OF THINGS._

_Piscator (at the top of his voice)._ "HI--TOM! BRING THE LANDING-NET;
HE'S PULLED ME IN, AND GOT ROUND A POST."]

_Young Lady._ "PRAY, CABMAN, ARE YOU ENGAGED?"

_Cabman._ "LOR BLESS YER, MISS, WHY, I'VE BEEN MARRIED THIS SEVEN

_Betting Flunkey._ "LOST? I BELIEVE YER! AND LOST A HATFULL OF MONEY
ON THE HOAKS, TOO; AND HOW I'M TO SETTLE WITHOUT PARTING WITH MY
JEWELLERY, I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW! AH, MR. BOTTLES, ITS HARD LINES TO
WAIT AT TABLE WITH SUCH CARES AND HANXIETIES."]

_Policeman._ "NOW, MUM! WHAT'S THE MATTER?"

_Injured Female._ "IF YOU PLEASE, MISTER--I WANT TO GIVE MY WRETCH OF A
'USBAND IN CHARGE. HE'S ALLVAYS A KNOCKING OF ME DOWN AND A STAMPIN' ON

WILL YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO LET HIM 'AVE THE SECOND?"]

BOKER'S GOT ANOTHER FOREHEAD AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD."

    [BOKER _is delighted_.]


[Illustration: _INNOCENT AND AMUSING LITTLE TRICK FOR LITTLE BOYS._

AN OLD LADY IS CROSSING THE STREET, WHEN A LITTLE BOY SHOUTS OUT--"HI!"
AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE. THE OLD LADY (ALTHOUGH INDEED THERE IS NO REAL
CAUSE FOR ALARM) STARTS, AND BECOMES GREATLY AGITATED, AND IMAGINES
THAT SHE IS RUN OVER BY AN OMNIBUS. THIS IS AN EXCEEDINGLY PLEASANT
TRICK.]


[Illustration: _SOLICITUDE._

_Child (screams and without any stops)._ "HANNER MARIA YER TIRESOME
HAGGERWATIN' LITTLE USSY COME OUT OF THE ROAD DO WITH YER LITTLE
BROTHER DID YER WANT TO BE RUNNED OVER BY OMNIBUSTES AND KILLED DEAD OH
DEAR OH DEAR WHO'D BE A NUSS?"]


[Illustration: _ANOTHER._

THIS IS EQUALLY DIVERTING. A LITTLE BOY RUSHES BY AN OLD GENTLEMAN AND
"YOWLS" LIKE A DOG. THE OLD GENTLEMAN IS TERRIFIED BEYOND MEASURE. IF
AT THE SAME TIME THE LITTLE BOY SHOULD ALSO PINCH THE LEG OF THE OLD
GENTLEMAN, THE FORCE OF THE JOKE IS MUCH HEIGHTENED; BUT THEN INDEED HE
MUST HAVE COURAGE, AND BE VERY ADROIT, OR HE MAY CHANCE TO GET A GREAT
BANG FROM AN UMBRELLA OR STICK.]

PARASOL. WHAT WILL MISSUS SAY?"]

_Sentimental Young Lady._ "WILL YOU BE SO OBLIGING, MR. TONGS, AS TO
CUT OFF A LONG PIECE OF HAIR WHERE IT WILL NOT BE MISSED?"]


[Illustration: _ALARMING._

THE OLD LADY IS SUPPOSED (AFTER A GREAT EFFORT) TO HAVE MADE UP
HER MIND TO TRAVEL, JUST FOR ONCE, BY ONE "OF THOSE NEW-FANGLED
RAILWAYS," AND THE FIRST THING SHE BEHOLDS ON ARRIVING AT THE STATION,
IS THE ABOVE MOST ALARMING PLACARD.]


[Illustration: _A SKETCH AT RAMSGATE._

_Ellen (who loves a joke at AUNT FIDGET'S expense)._ "GOOD GRACIOUS,
AUNT, THERE ARE TWO OFFICERS!"

_Aunt Fidget (a short-sighted lady)._ "BLESS ME, SO THERE ARE! WELL;
THEY MAY BE OFFICERS, BUT THEY ARE NOT GENTLEMEN, I'M SURE, OR THEY
WOULDN'T STAND LOOKING AT US IN THAT IMPUDENT MANNER."]

FINISHED; BUT I SHOULD LIKE THE DEAR CHILD'S EXPRESSION PRESERVED."]

_Rapid Undergraduate._ "WELL, JACKSON! YOU SEE THEY'VE PLUCKED
ME AGAIN."

_Porter of St. Boniface._ "YE-ES, SIR, I WAS VERY SORRY WHEN I
'EARD OF IT, SIR."

_Undergraduate._ "AH! I DID INTEND GOING INTO THE CHURCH, AND
BEING AN ORNAMENT TO THE PROFESSION--BUT AS THEY WON'T LET
ME THROUGH--I THINK--I SHALL CUT THE WHOLE CONCERN."]

_Young Sister._ "I SHOULD SO LIKE TO GO TO A PARTY, MA."

AM SURE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TIMES), THAT UNTIL FLORA IS MARRIED, IT IS
UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO GO OUT; SO DO NOT ALLUDE TO THE SUBJECT

MR. BRIGGS'S PLEASURES OF HORSEKEEPING.


[Illustration: No. V.

MR. BRIGGS, DETERMINED TO HAVE NO MORE INFERIOR HORSES, GIVES A GOOD
